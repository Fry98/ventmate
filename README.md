# VentMate
External tool that allows its user to teleport their in-game character in [**Among Us**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) with no restrictions. Built in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) using [memoryjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoryjs) for process memory manipulation.

This tool was created for educational purposes only so... maybe don't actually cheat. Thanks.
